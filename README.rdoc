= jQuery LiveTwitter

LiveTwitter is a lightweight, live updating Twitter search plugin for jQuery.
Tested against 1.3.x, but any recent version should do.

== Usage

 <div id="twitterSearch"></div>

 $("#twitterSearch").liveTwitter('bacon', {limit: 10, rate: 15000});

You can also show tweets from a user's timeline:

 $("#twitterSearch").liveTwitter('elektronaut', {limit: 10, rate: 300000, mode: 'user_timeline'});

Changing the query or options is pretty easy, just call liveTwitter again with the new parameters:

 $("#twitterSearch").liveTwitter('salad');
 $("#twitterSearch").liveTwitter('celery', {limit: 25});
 $("#twitterSearch").liveTwitter(false, {limit: 25});

You can also stop, start and refresh manually::

 $("#twitterSearch").each(function(){ this.twitter.stop(); });
 $("#twitterSearch").each(function(){ this.twitter.start(); });
 $("#twitterSearch").each(function(){ this.twitter.refresh(); });
